let's create a list of next ideas to try for the model, and prioritise them in order of what we think is going to be the most impactful

1. Increasing "roof-centered-ness" of gfrid and rid2 training data; two options i can think of
a) add overlap to the tiling generation -> more data with different contexts, and overall more roof centered areas
b) just use the roof centered data -> overlap will likely be higher in general, and less uniform than overlapping tiles due to eg. terraces where homes are very close together

2. architectural changes
a) add a guassian to the roof keypoint data - either we do thing like RoofMapNet by having learned alpha and beta, or we just add this to the data to have label smoothing
b) other additions from roofmapnet -> issue here is that I tried trianing that model before, and it's very much hampered by the fact that no trianing code was released. It was a bit of guesswork trying to reconstruct it. I'd rather stick to something more simple at the moment, and prioritise data work rather than model work

3. other models
a) we saw some signs that once gfrid data was added to azimuth training that accuracy of azimuth prediction was better. We could try and see if instance segmentation of roof segments would work better with gfrid + roofmapnet + rid2 data. This is also essentially what google solar traing their models off (except theirs is generated by graph cut on DSMs rather than labelled by humans)

4. Other hyperparameter tweaks to the current setup
a) MORE oversampling of gfrid?

5. any other ideas?
